# Claude Usage Bar

**Your Claude Code rate limits, running agents and prompt caches, in the macOS menu bar.**

Native Swift, a single binary, no dependencies, no Xcode project. Idle CPU is
indistinguishable from zero.

## What's new

| Date | Release | What landed |
|---|---|---|
| 6 Oct 2026 | **v0.4** | **Keep Cache Warm** — pin an idle session and its prompt cache never lapses. The next real turn read 99% of its context from cache. |
| 3 Oct 2026 | **v0.3** | **Control panel** — a *Needs you* queue for sessions blocked on a dialog, a **5-hour pace forecast** (`full by 3:40 PM`), and a flag for busy sessions that have gone silent. |
| 24 Sep 2026 | **v0.2** | **Live agent counts** — busy/waiting/idle sessions plus in-flight subagents, labelled with Conductor chat titles. |
| 20 Sep 2026 | **v0.1** | **Usage in the menu bar** — 5-hour and 7-day utilisation, coloured as they near the limit. |

Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

- **Rate limits at a glance.** 5-hour and 7-day windows, each turning orange at
  70% and red at 90% using stock macOS colours.
- **Pace forecast.** A line fitted to the last hour of readings tells you whether
  the 5-hour window will fill before it resets. It reflects your real plan limit,
  including claude.ai and other machines.
- **Needs you.** Sessions waiting on a permission dialog or question jump to the
  top, badge the menu bar with `⚑N`, and notify you after a minute.
- **Working sessions.** Turn duration, context size once it passes 200k, and
  `⚠ silent` when a busy session has written nothing for 10 minutes — usually a
  hung tool or MCP call.
- **Agent counts.** Top-level sessions and background subagents (`2 busy (+3)`),
  with a spinner in the menu bar while anything runs.
- **Prompt cache status.** Each idle session shows its last cache hit and time
  until the cache lapses (`97% 42m`), or `cold`.
- **Keep Cache Warm.** Pin a session and it is pinged shortly before the cache
  expires, so coming back to it costs cache-read prices, not a full rewrite.
  One avoided cold turn pays for about 20 pings.

Works with any Claude Code session. If you use [Conductor](https://conductor.build),
sessions are labelled with their chat titles and get an **Open in Conductor** action.

## Install

Requires macOS 13+, the Xcode Command Line Tools, and Claude Code signed in on
this Mac.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakthi535squad/claude-usage-bar.git
cd claude-usage-bar
./build.sh            # builds and installs /Applications/ClaudeUsage.app
open -a ClaudeUsage
```

On first launch macOS asks to let the app read the `Claude Code-credentials`
Keychain item — choose **Always Allow**. Enable **Open at Login** from the menu.

## Privacy and cost

- **One network call:** `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, every
  5 minutes, the same endpoint Claude Code's `/usage` uses. It is undocumented
  and may change.
- **Your token stays in the Keychain.** It is read fresh on each poll and never
  stored or sent anywhere else.
- **Everything else is local file reads** of `~/.claude` (and Conductor's
  database, read-only) and costs nothing against your rate limit.
- **Keep Cache Warm spends tokens.** Each ping is a one-turn `claude -p` call at
  cache-read prices. Pins expire after 8 hours, pause when the 5-hour window
  reaches 90%, and every ping is logged with its cost to
  `~/.config/claude-usage-bar/keepwarm.log`.

## Command line

```bash
ClaudeUsage --dump                  # print what the menu bar shows
ClaudeUsage --dump --cache-only     # exercise the offline fallback
ClaudeUsage --agents                # session rows as the dropdown shows them
ClaudeUsage --ping <pid> --dry-run  # the exact command a keep-warm ping would run
./test.sh                           # unit tests
```

`ClaudeUsage` is `/Applications/ClaudeUsage.app/Contents/MacOS/ClaudeUsage`.

## How it works

Rate-limit polling and backoff, how agents and subagents are counted from
transcripts, why the spinner is a Core Animation layer (0.37% CPU at 60 fps vs
6.6% for an animated title), and how a keep-warm ping reproduces a session's
cache prefix byte-for-byte: [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

## Roadmap

- Customisable colour thresholds, per window, with a time-aware warning for the
  5-hour window ([#2](https://github.com/sakthi535squad/claude-usage-bar/issues/2)).
